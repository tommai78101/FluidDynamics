Working proof of concept of Fluid Dynamics

This is a Java Swing / Java AWT application demonstrating fluid simulations in action.

It is split into two components:

* The interface uses the Java Swing for the window wrapper as well as interfacing with the mouse.
* The graphics uses the Java AWT component.
* The core functionality resides in the `FluidDynamics` class object.

## Controls

* Primary Mouse Button - Apply density (dye) in the fluid.
* Middle Mouse Wheel Button - Reset simulation.
* Secondary Mouse Button - Apply fluid velocity.

## How to Build

* Requires Java 8 SDK or above.

There is no need to use Maven or Gradle to build this project.

After cloning the project, import the project into a Java-compatible IDE of your choice, and then Run / Debug the application.
